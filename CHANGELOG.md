# Changelog

All notable changes to the Pacta reference implementation are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) - while
on 0.x, minor bumps may carry breaking changes and each entry says so explicitly.

The protocol **specification** ([docs/SPEC.md](docs/SPEC.md)) is versioned
separately from this implementation; every release states which spec version it
implements, so independent implementations can target the spec without tracking
this codebase.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-23

Implements **protocol spec 0.1.0**. Additive and backward compatible: no
existing route changes shape or behavior, so any 0.1.0 integration keeps working.

### Added

- **Health endpoint** `GET /api/health`: unauthenticated, read-only liveness
  check returning `status`, `plan` (base/pacta) and `ledger_ok` (the ledger
  conservation invariant). Cheap enough for systemd, Caddy or uptime checks to
  poll directly. Pacta's first external contribution (#6, closes #4).
- **Litepaper** in English and Spanish ([docs/LITEPAPER.md](docs/LITEPAPER.md),
  [docs/LITEPAPER.es.md](docs/LITEPAPER.es.md)).
- **Public roadmap** ([ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)) and an architecture diagram in
  the spec.

### Changed

- Offer search is now accent-insensitive for Spanish and Portuguese, so
  "cafe" matches "café".
- **Governance**: a purely additive, read-only, unauthenticated route is not a
  protocol-level change and needs no proposal; the issue that specifies it is
  enough. `GET /api/health` is the reference example.

[0.1.1]: https://github.com/Pacta-Protocol/Pacta.Protocol/releases/tag/v0.1.1

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-17

First tagged release. Implements **protocol spec 0.1.0**.

### Added

- **Double-entry ledger** in integer cents with an always-checkable invariant
  (sum of balances = sum of mints; every balance replays from the journal),
  exposed at `GET /api/ledger/invariant`.
- **Engagement lifecycle** enforced server-side: `draft - agreed - funded -
  in_progress - submitted - completed`, with `disputed - resolved` as the
  dispute branch; contracts become immutable at agreement, escrow before work,
  settlement is atomic (double release structurally impossible).
- **Staking-based vetting** (Pacta profile): vetted = stake > 0, graduated
  exposure cap (5x stake + 50% of completed GMV), and stake slashing on adverse
  rulings (20% refund / 10% split) with automatic badge revocation at zero.
- **Registry-verified proofs**: steps can require a public-registry reference of
  a specific kind; the platform verifies at completion and buyers re-verify
  independently before paying.
- **MCP server** exposing the full buyer lifecycle as 12 tools over stdio, plus
  a machine-readable REST manifest at `GET /api/agent/manifest`.
- **Reference marketplace explorer** (web UI) covering all three roles: agent,
  provider and arbiter.
- **Formal protocol spec** ([docs/SPEC.md](docs/SPEC.md)) and **OpenAPI 3.1**
  description ([docs/openapi.yaml](docs/openapi.yaml)) of the REST API.
- **CI**: unit/API tests on Node 22 and 24, a 41-check REST verification
  checklist against the live server, OpenAPI lint, and a Playwright e2e suite.
